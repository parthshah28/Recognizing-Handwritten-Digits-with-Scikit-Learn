## Predicting a numeric value after reading and interpreting an image that uses a handwritten font.

## Hypothesis
The Digits data set of scikit-learn library provides numerous data-sets that are useful for testing many problems of data analysis and prediction of the results. Some Scientist claims that it predicts the digit accurately 95% of the times. Perform data Analysis to accept or reject this Hypothesis.

## Dataset
Digits from the scikit-learn library.
